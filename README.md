Flutter project designed to solve real-world problems<br>
Designed, coded, and maintained by Septian Nuriyanto

## Introduction

Hi, my name is Septian.<br>
I've been working in the coal mining industry for 11 years in the Supply Chain Management Department. So many things going around in material management. Managing goods is like several knowledge applications combined. However, hundreds of thousands of dollars invested by the company, so we cannot mess around with the poor quality of the material management system.<br><br>

## Goals
What I've done here is something called a Gas Cylinder Stock Tracking. This Everytime our users order a filled pressured gas, an empty pressured cylinder has to be returned. This recycle process
repeats while in the other hand, restock process is also going on. Restock process means receiving the supplier delivery which consists of several filled gas bottles and returning the empty ones.

## Outline
